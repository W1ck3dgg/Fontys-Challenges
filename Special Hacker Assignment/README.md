# Special Assignment
Once you enter the website, you will see a big table that contains names, numbers and points. 
At first all items of the table start in mixed order(neither descending, nor ascending), so when an arrow is clicked it based on what you have clicked (number, name or points) it will be sorted in Ascending order and clicking it again will make it in Descending order.
